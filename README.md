# Flip Indicator Plugin
## Description:
Tired of mis-flipping or whiffing by flipping incorrectly? With this plugin, you get simple instant feedback on how you flipped. Once your car flips it will tell you the exact angle you flipped towards. It even comes with a GUI dial to point in the direction of your flip. It's great for lower ranks to lock in fundamentals, and even higher ranks to practice/learn new mechanics such as dashes.

### Issues? / Requests?
Noticing any bugs? Wish there was some functionality not implemented? Let me know by creating an issue in the issue tab. This way I can keep improving the plugin and ensuring it always works for those who want it.

#### About:
I made this plugin for my friend Jake who was wishing a plugin like this existed. I figured I'd give it a shot, now I may make some more plugins in the future.
