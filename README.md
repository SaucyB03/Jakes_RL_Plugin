# Flip Indicator Plugin
## Notes for Bakkesmod reviewers:
- I tried my best for submitting my pluin correctly, however in the programming wiki there are 2 ways listed of submission and there is another while making the submission. I am unsure if I did it correctly because it also doesn't fully specify where to put images. 
- I would love this plugin on bakkesmod since my friend (Jake) has been wishing for a plugin like this for a long time. It be really cool if he could just install it through bakkesmod.
- If there are issues with my submission please let me know either through bakkesmod or at bradon.soucy@uvm.edu. I will then fix them and resubmit thanks!
